      <p class="reviewtext">This review is for the 2nd generation (Gen 2) of Xida Club Sport shock absorbers built to
        949Racing's
        specifications by Tractive and sold by 949 Racing under their Supermiata brand.
        <br>Xida Single-Adjustable shocks with tender spring setup. 20 clicks of adjustment,
        800 lb/in front springs 600 lb/in rear springs.
        <br>
        The damping profile on these shocks is digressive and rebound and compression are both adjusted in a single
        adjuster
        on top of the shock bodies and come with 20 clicks of adjustment.
        <br>
        <br>
        These were installed on my 2004 Mazdaspeed Miata for Autocross and daily driver duties.

      <p class="reviewtext">The Xida damping was designed with keeping as consistent a contact patch as possible in a
        competition
        environment
        with super stick r-compound tires. As a result you get a very wide range of adjustment to try out for your
        road
        conditions and use.
        <br>
        However, I did find a set of shock dyno sheets on the Gen2 Xidas over on Miataturbo.net and I was able to
        get
        arough
        idea of the damping range and where I needed to set everything to start with for my intended use (Autocross
        on
        200
        treadwear tires and occasionally on 40 treadwear Hoosier A7s).
        <br>
        <br>
        I figured setting 10 (from full stiff) on the rear shock was around .41, .39, .46, .33 at 1, 2, 5, and 10
        IPS.
        <br>
        Front shocks at setting 5 from full stiff were around .43, .37, .26, .23 at 1, 2, 5, and 10 IPS.
        <br>
        <br>
        Once I had a range to play in, dialing them in was super easy thanks to the adjusters being very consistent
        and
        with
        reqpeatable results.
        On the street, I settled on 11 from full stiff rear and 7 from full stiff front.
        <br>
        <br>
        These settings provide just enough body control to keep the handling nice, but allows for the body to not
        get
        as
        upset over big surface undulations and broken pavement.
        The tires also still do a really good job of keeping contact with the ground.
        I would argue at these settings it feels like a more img-fluid NC2 Miata, but with tighter body control,
        morshock
        travel, and better grip over any surface.
        <br>
        It basically turns a focused Autocross car back into a street friendly daily driver.
      </p>

      <h2>Autocross Impressions</h2>

      <p class="reviewtext">For Hoosiers I found that setting the front 3 or 4 from full stiff was just about
        perfect
        and setting the
        rears
        to
        8 or 7 from full stiff worked really well regardless of surface conditions.
        <br>
        For 200 treadware Rival-S 1.5 tires in the same 225/45/15 size:
        <br>
        Wet Track: 5 front, 8 rear.
        <br>
        Dry track: 4 front, 7 rear.
        <br>
        <br>
        The result is a setup that responds really quickly to every input but is remarkably easy to drive at the
        limit
        since
        bumps and ridges really don't upset the contact patch and are shrugged off. You might get a little jostled
        in
        the
        cabin because of the increased low-speed damping, but the contact patch isn't disturbed.
        <br>
        <br>
        These shocks also do an amazing job of putting power down even with the stock Torsen differential in the
        Mazdaspeed,
        which came as a bit of a revelation to me as I suddenly had more under-steer exiting corners undepower.
        "Slide
        and
        catch" replaced with "foot down and go.""
        The Hoosiers can still lift the inside tire on corner entry and in a sweeper if you run too much damping
        on
        the
        rear.
        <br>
        <br>
        If you should leave the Autocross shock settings on the car for the drive home you're greeted with a ride
        quality
        similar to a 911 GT3 RS or C7 Z06. Very firm and img-fluid and a tad more jarring, but nothing unbearable.
      </p>


      <h2>Final verdict, closing thoughts, and ramblings:</h2>

      <p>If I knew just how much grip the 225 Hoosier A7s were going to produce I would have increased the front
        sprinrate
        to
        900 or 1000 lb/in when I ordered my set.
        If you intend to run Hoosiers exclusively you should upgrade the front springs for additional roll
        stiffness.
        <br>
        <br>
        There were a few instances where I wish I had sprung for the 3-way adjustable Xidas to fine tune the
        compression
        damping for autocross use, but at the price point for the single adjustables these shocks are remarkably
        capable
        and
        easily the best bang for the buck at local events and for a dual or triple-use car.
        <br>
        <br>
        At first I was missing the additional compression damping of my FCM shocks, but adapting to the Xidas
        was
        quick
        process, and the car isn't any slower by any means. In fact, outside of my first two events dialing in
        the
        shocks
        the car is just as quick if not faster thanks to being able to better put power down out of the corners
        even
        with
        the rear sway-bar attached.
        <br>
        <br>
        Overall I think these are amazing setup at a decent price point. I haven't really driven anything in
        this
        price
        bracket that is as capable in the handling and ride department.
