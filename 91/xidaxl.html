        <p>This review is for the 2nd generation (Gen 2) of Xida XL coilovers built to 949Racing's specifications by
          Tractive
          and sold by 949 Racing under their Supermiata brand.
          <br>Xida Single-Adjustable shocks with tender spring setup. 20 clicks of adjustment,
          300 lb/in front springs 200 lb/in rear springs.
          <br>
          These were installed on my 1991 Miata which also has a non-adjustable RacingBeat 15/16" (part number 54100)
          front
          sway-bar.
          <br>
          The damping profile on these shocks is digressive and rebound and compression are both adjusted in a single
          adjuster
          on top of the shock bodies and come with 20 clicks of adjustment.

        <h2>Street Impressions</h2>

        </center>
        <p>I will preface this by saying that I am no stranger to softer sprung Miata coil-overs and have driven a huge
          variety of shock and spring setups on these cars. Everything from Flyin'Miata springs and various shocks to
          Megan
          Racing to budget Bilstein setups to Vmaxx to Tein coil-overs, and even generation 1 Xidas with 450/300 rates.
          This
          car was previously on FCM 1040 coil-overs with 325/250 spring rates, so I’m not upgrading from a worn-out
          stock
          setup for comparison (although I have driven a LOT of those in my time).</p>

        <p>With the Mazdaspeed as my autocross monster and a nice new Chevy Silverado as my work vehicle, my 91 is a
          street-only car and is the daily driver when I am home. So naturally it has to be able to do certain things
          better
          than most. It has to have AC, it has to have longer life tires that won’t have issues when it rains, and it
          needs
          to
          be able to transition from twisty road fun car to comfortable daily driver on the broken and ill-kept streets
          of
          the
          greater Houston area at the turn of a dial.
          <br>
          My old FCMs were a good compromise at both, airing more on the sporty side of things. After several years of
          use
          the
          bumpstops and top hat bushings were gone and I was ready to try something new.
          <br>
          My recent experience with the Xida Sports on my Mazdaspeed gave an indication I would probably be very happy
          with
          a
          set of Xida XLs with soft spring rates.

        <p>I have not driven on any suspension setup in the Miata world that rides better than this. Running at
          full-soft
          on
          the shocks yields a comfortable ride that soaks up sharp impacts and surface undulations with decent
          bodycontrol,
          and only feels a little under-damped on really big impacts or when doing quick transitional maneuvers such as
          a
          slalom or a set of switch-backs on a twisty road.


          And the ride quality stays consistent but with fewer body motions and better response as you turn the shocks
          up
          a
          click or two from full soft. I haven’t seen a need or want to go much above 4 front and 3 rear on the street
          to
          maintain good body control while cornering and excellent ride quality, even with a passenger.
          Now don’t take all this talk of wonderful ride quality to mean that the Xidas are a slouch when it comes to
          handling, they do just as well and even more so than my old FCMs or anything off the shelf with similar spring
          rates.
          <br>
          <br>
          With the more track-biased bump to rebound ratio and double digressive valving, the all-season tires feel like
          they
          have gained more steady-state and transitional grip compared to when I was on the FCMs and running with more
          camber
          than what I have now. Mid-corner bumps and ridges in particular are dispatched with no drama at all and never
          require you to change your steering or throttle input to correct for it.
          <br>
          <br>
          The car is still a hoot to blast down a twisty road with and body control is excellent running about 3 to 4
          clicks
          in the front and 3 to 2 clicks in the rear. You can always go stiffer if you want to increase the already
          excellent
          response, but I cannot see a point in doing so on tiny 185 width tires.
        </p>

        <h5>Final verdict, closing thoughts, and ramblings:</h5>

        <p>For some people, spending $2,169 dollars on a suspension system might be overkill. In my experience after
          17
          years
          of driving Miatas with all sorts of suspension/wheel/tire setups (and the majority of those different setups
          being
          on my own cars) I find it amazing there is an option out there at this level of ride comfort and handling and
          build
          quality for only $2,169 dollars complete and ready to drop in.
