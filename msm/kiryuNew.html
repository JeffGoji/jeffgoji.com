<p><strong>My car's history:</strong>
    <br>
    This car has been amazing. Out of all the Miatas I can safely say the Mazdaspeed variants are probably my
    absolute
    favorite of the breed. You have that amazing NB2 chassis but you get a turbocharger and beefed up engine
    internals
    and drivetrain components, and did I mention the turbocharger?
    <br>
    <br>
    In stock trim these cars got a dulled down treatment from Mazda with a reduced redline (a lowly 6700 rpm fuel
    cut)
    and boost pressure set to 8.5 psi by a factory electronic boost controller, all designed around making the
    engine
    last 200K miles and the drive train componnents just as long. Seems like a loser with a 2,527 lb curb weight,
    but
    what those of us who enjoyed modding our Miatas saw was potential for a 200 wheel-horsepower Miata with minimal
    investment and excellent reliability. And that is exactly what we got.
    <br>
    <br>
    After winning my 2007 season in C-stock for the Houston region in a MSM I fell in love with the car. Finally a
    Miata
    that had power from the factory. Even though the turbocharger was handicapped and the redline was lower and the
    gearing in the 6-speed transmission made no sense, it still produced a whopping 154 horsepower and 144 lb-ft of
    torque at the wheels!
    <br>
    Which in case you haven't noticed is significantly more than the 115 horsepower and the 107 lb-ft of the regular
    01-05 NB cars.

<p>
    So in October 2008 I bought my own Mazdaspeed Miata. And I was quite happy for a very long time. In 2012 I began
    modifying it for a "anything goes" autocross class in the Houston BMW club and had a blast doing so.
    <br>
    <br>
    First I added a FCM suspension with massive 800/500 springs and then 225/45/15 Autocross dedicated tires and a
    big 1
    1/8th" Racing Beat front swaybar and a few other small tricks. The car was fun and it was fairly quick.
    <br>
    <br>Over the next few years I modified and tweaked and eventually had a class-winning Mazdaspeed (2 time STO
    class
    champion in Houston region SCCA that would compete in the top 3 for top time of day on street tires from 2015 to
    2018).
