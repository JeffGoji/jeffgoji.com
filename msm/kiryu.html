      <p>Ride height measurements were done at the pinch welds at the furthest ends of the front and back of the car
        on a 225/45/15 tire (23” diameter).
        <br>
        This method of ride height measurement will give you the most accurate and repeatable results and is a
        common
        standard in the Miata autocross and track world.
        <br>
        4.50 to 4.75 is a good range to work in, I run 0 rake, some drivers prefer some rake and some prefer
        negative
        rake.
        <br>
        In general on the NA/NB chassis you can adjust the rear ride height of the car by about 3/4ths of an inch
        before it begins to noticeably affect the alignment in any meaningful way.
        <br>
        <br>
        I experimented with dozens of alignment settings and ultimately settled on the numbers below.
        I found that anything above 3.6 degrees of camber didn’t get enough heat in the front tires to make them
        work
        optimally, and anything above -2.8 degrees in the rear resulted in worse traction when launching and when
        trying to get power down out of a corner.
        <br>
        <br>
        Swaybars are a pretty simple affair. I run a Racing Beat 1.25” front bar on it’s stiffest setting
        (inner-most
        hole) and the rear bar disconnected to let the helical gear differential hook-up on corner exit.

        This car has been amazing. Out of all the Miatas I can safely say the Mazdaspeed variants are probably my
        absolute
        favorite of the breed. You have that amazing NB2 chassis but you get a turbocharger and beefed up engine
        internals
        and drivetrain components, and did I mention the turbocharger?
        <br>
        <br>
        In stock trim these cars got a dulled down treatment from Mazda with a reduced redline (a lowly 6700 rpm
        fuel
        cut)
        and boost pressure set to 8.5 psi by a factory electronic boost controller, all designed around making the
        engine
        last 200K miles and the drive train componnents just as long. Seems like a loser with a 2,527 lb curb
        weight,
        but
        what those of us who enjoyed modding our Miatas saw was potential for a 200 wheel-horsepower Miata with
        minimal
        investment and excellent reliability. And that is exactly what we got.
        <br>
        <br>
        After winning my 2007 season in C-stock for the Houston region in a MSM I fell in love with the car.
        Finally
        a
        Miata
        that had power from the factory. Even though the turbocharger was handicapped and the redline was lower
        and
        the
        gearing in the 6-speed transmission made no sense, it still produced a whopping 154 horsepower and 144
        lb-ft
        of
        torque at the wheels!
        <br>
        Which in case you haven't noticed is significantly more than the 115 horsepower and the 107 lb-ft of the
        regular
        01-05 NB cars.
        <br>
        So in October 2008 I bought my own Mazdaspeed Miata. And I was quite happy for a very long time. In 2012 I
        began
        modifying it for a "anything goes" autocross class in the Houston BMW club and had a blast doing so.
        <br>
        First I added a FCM suspension with massive 800/500 springs and then 225/45/15 Autocross dedicated tires and
        a
        big 1 1/8th" Racing Beat front swaybar and a few other small tricks. The car was fun and it was fairly
        quick.
        <br>
        Over the next few years I modified and tweaked and eventually had a class-winning Mazdaspeed (2 time STO
        class
        champion in Houston region SCCA that would compete in the top 3 for top time of day on street tires from
        2015
        to
        2018).
