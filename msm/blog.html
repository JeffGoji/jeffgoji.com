            <p>Since Kiryu is acting as a daily driver again I thought it would be nice to have a full trunk interior
                again. Only problem is I gave away the spare wheel a few years ago to a friend who needed one and he has
                since sold his Miata with said spare.
                <br>
                <br>
                So I ended up taking a drive out to Sealy Texas to see my buddy Austin Snader who owns SR Enterprises, a
                shop and Miata part supplier. $40 dollars later I had a spare wheel and tire and a few essential clips
                and bolts I was missing.
                <br>
                One issue is that the spare wheel itself probably won't fit over the big-brake kit in the front, so it's
                only real purpose is to level out the trunk area and make it OEM. Also the tire is slashed, so that
                would need to be replaced at some point.
                <br>
                <br>
                Before installation began, I made a cut out in the upper left section of the metal panel and the
                interior carpet to access the
                damper adjuster on the top of the shock body, and I found on the passenger's side that the interior hard
                plastic has an elevated
                section that fits just above the Xida adjuster on the passenger's side. I need to come up with some kind
                of re-enforcement for that area to keep the adjuster safe.
                <br>
                I also picked up some interior push pins from O'Reilly's to replace all the missing plastic push
                buttons.

            <p>I took some time out to get some much needed maintenance done on the car today. The car was throwing a
                check engine light for a faulty gas cap. I tried cleaning it and the code ended up coming back, so I had
                to bite the bullet on a OEM replacement. The AC/power steering belt was also looking a bit chewed up
                after well over 8 years of use so it had to be replaced as well. Thank goodness replacing the belt on a
                Miata is a remarkably simple affair requiring one deep well socket and a few wrenches.
                <br>
                <br>
                I wish I had more of an update to share with you, but so far it’s been a pretty uneventful month. I have
                been using the car quite a bit more to make sure it doesn’t sit and because it has an amazing AC system
                (Gas Head Motorworks made a few modifications to it for me a few years ago).
                <br>
                I can say that every single time I drive it I find the thought of selling it to be more and more absurd.
                I think once school is finished I’ll go ahead and plunk the money down on a full engine rebuild and a
                rollbar and start hitting up a few track events next year.

            <p>This entry is a few months late and well overdue. Unfortunately our racing season came to an abrupt
                end on March 14th at a PCA Autocross event. The
                engine fan relay had burnt out and fortunately I caught it before I took my second run on the
                course.
                <br>
                The bad news is it did lose some compression and will need to be rebuilt before I can go racing with
                it again. The good news is that the head gasket is still intact and the car is drivable for daily
                driving.
                <br>
                <br>
                I suppose it was just a matter of time before something like this happened, and I really can't be
                upset about it as I was going to retire the car at the end of this year. The car has had an amazing
                run over the last few years and has won three championships to it's credit. I wish I had been able
                to finish the 2021 season and get one more trophy on the wall before I decided if I was going to
                reitre it or not, but these things do happen.
                <br>
                <br>
                The current plan is to rebuild it when I have the time. I really can't see myself parting with the
                car anytime soon, I mean why would I give up my Mona Lisa that I have worked so hard and corrected
                almost every single factory issue it came with.
