          bar instead of having to code one in to every since page I make. I was going to use PHP but I couldn't get the
          JS and CSS to play well with each other and the navbar looked pretty low rent.
          <br>This update preserves the design and function of the original navbar and saves me a lot of coding when I
          add or remove pages.

          also working on some background image updates and I am working on the "Review page" so I can have a
