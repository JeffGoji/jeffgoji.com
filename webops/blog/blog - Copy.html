        <p class="blog">As of yesterday I have officially enrolled in the Rice University Full-Stack Web Development
            program. And in doing so it puts my job search officially on hold for anything outside of a part-time job.
            Needless to say, I am very excited to be starting this program and I am looking forward to the journey and
            of course, the skills and job opportunities that await.
            <br>
            <br>
            So you’re probably wondering why a self taught programmer would go the paid institution route, and that’s a
            damn fine question. The answer is that in this day and age, sadly, hiring managers want to see some kind of
            certificate to prove you can even advance to the interview level. And that’s not just me and my
            observations, that comes from talking to several hiring managers in the field two of whom are close friends.
            <br>
            College degree? Almost useless. It shows you knew how to party for 4 years.
            <br>Self-taught? Better have an
            amazing
            library of projects to back you up and a portfolio of websites ready to go (this takes a long time to build
            up on account of the fast and ready companies out there that want to make you site for an ultra low price
            and the “do it yourself” route that most customers choose to go down.)
            <br>
            Web Development is a huge field but it is also over-saturated and hiring managers need something more to get
            their attention.
            <br>
            <br>
            Now the next question you might be asking is "Why Rice University?" Well, here in Houston, Rice University
            is a
            respectable institution and they have a proper “Career Development” service that works with you from day one
            to help you get a job. Not just another job board to post on and hope you land an interview or a job board
            that companies might post on and you’re hoping you get an interview in a tiny tank of fellow hungry sharks.
            <br>
            <br>
            I think this is the best move I can make right now, and one that will lead to bigger and better things.
            <br>
            And if they do, wonderful! I’ll write about it here. If it does not, wonderful! I’ll write about it here.

        <p class="blog">We decided to come down to the beach for the Memorial Day weekend with some friends. Nothing
            more rleaxing to code to than the sound of the waves rolling in and the wind.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h1 id="52421">Blog Entry for 5/24/2021</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="blog">Today was a really good day. I spoke with a couple of recruiters, one of
            whom was
            really amazing
            and
            gave
            me
            some very valuable feedback and I like that she is a fellow Houstonian. I also had
            my first tech
            interview.
            <br>
            Naturally I hope something comes of these conversations on the job front, but if not
            I certainly
            hold no
            ill-will towards anyone I spoke to or the companies for not choosing me for a job or
            getting me
            hired
            somewhere.
            <br>
            Because if we look at it from another perspective, as people breaking into the tech
            industry we
            will
            spend many hours making coversheets and tweaking our resumes and hopefully
            interviewing and all
            with
            no
            success at all.
            <br>
            So we should enjoy the few really good experiences and learning opportunities we
            have during the
            process of trying to find that first developer job.
            <br>
            Like I always say, a day where you don't learn something is a day wasted.

        <p class="blog">Hello world!
            <br>This will be the first of a series of entries for my blog on my path to becoming
            a Web
            Developer.
            <br>But first, a little bit
            about myself;
            <br>
            I learned HTML in 2000 and built a few websites for various things. I had a couple
            of fan sites
            for
            a
            couple
            TV shows I enjoyed, and I built several business pages for friends and for two
            customers. I
            never
            was a
            pro at JavaScript, but I knew enough to impliment shopping cart functions and
            features.
            <br>
            <br>
            After a long career in Oil and Gas I decided to turn one of my hobbies and passions
            into my
            career
            and
            started coding again.
            <br>
            Catching up on all the latest technologies has been a lot of fun, and I am so
            thankful for
            Google
            and
            the
            wide array of databases with helpful information in them. I'll be posting a full
            list of
            resources
            other
            Junior Developers can utilize in a future Blog post, so stay tuned!
            <br>
            <br>
            As it stands, I am completely caught up on the basics like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript,
            SQL, and the
            various
            tools (Bootstrap, jQuery, etc) to get what I want out of a page.
            I also taught myself Angular (which I am having a lot of fun with) and C# along with
            Python (I
            really
            like
            Python).
            <br>
            I also took some time to learn Word Press, and while I personally prefer actual
            coding from the
            ground
            up, I
            do understand its need in the world.
            <br>Going through and learning all these new methods has been a blast, and I am
            absolutely
            amazed at
            just
            how easy it is now to create apps, programs, websites, you name it.
            <br>
            The tools have come so far and really are amazing, and I am looking forward to a
            long career
            doing
            what
            I
            love.
            <br>
